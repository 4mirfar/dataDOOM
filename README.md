Welcome to **dataDOOM** — a personal data engineering and mining repository forged in the ashes of forgotten clusters. In a universe where pipelines are broken, schemas are corrupted, and documentation is extinct, this is where **data survivors** come to thrive.


## 🌒 What is dataDOOM?

dataDOOM is your last beacon in the cosmic void of entropy-filled data jungles.  
Built for explorers, scavengers, and rogue data engineers mining insights in the unknown.

This is not your average clean-room ETL project.  
This is **data combat**.  
No production constraints. No corporate boundaries.  
Just raw, chaotic, beautiful **DATA** — and the tools to make sense of it.

## 🔧 Tech Arsenal

_**Tools you might find here buried in old code tunnels:**_

- 🧱 **ETL pipelines**: custom-crafted and duct-taped together  
- ⚙️ **Data miners**: little creatures that crawl the web and underground JSON pits  
- 🧼 **Cleansers**: for when your CSVs come covered in ancient slime  
- 📊 **Analytics scripts**: reveal the shape of things buried  
- 📁 **Storage blueprints**: because you *will* need to hide what you find

## 🕳️ The Lore

In the remains of a long-forgotten data civilization, the few who remain attempt to reconnect the fragments.  
Sometimes you find a stream of clean, normalized records.  
Other times, you dig into a tunnel and unleash a horde of malformed dates and null values.

You’ve been warned.


## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository from the last signal tower:
